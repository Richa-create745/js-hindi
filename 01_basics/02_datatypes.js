//talking about datatypes in JavaScript...

//all the js code will be treated as newer version or newer js ,,as in previous js there is no conecpt of classes or modulees ,arrow function....
"use strict"; 

//alert("hello")  //cannot run till now as we are using nodejs not broowser,so in nodejs there is different syntax to use alert
console.log(9+3);// maintain code readability
console.log("here ,,we are ");

//datatypes
let name = "richa"; //string datatype
let age = 21; //number data type
let isLoggedIn = false; //boolean datatype
 //null => a dattype or we can say that it is a stand alone value, or a representation of empty value,,,we can assign it to variable too
let accountstate = null;
console.log(accountstate);

//undefined =>when no value is assigned to a variable

console.log(typeof " Richa");//helps in giving type of the value given to it...
console.log(typeof age);
console.log(typeof null);  //the type of null comes out to be=> object  
console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined
